Cheast sheet of C/C++ code.
# How this come from ?
Last week, I interviewed a candidate, and given him some coding practice question that generally appears in the sence of interview. I think it will be good to write some 'cheat sheets' by myself.

# What will be covering ?
This will be a long term "homework" for me to gather some "good code" in case of memory matter.

# What can you do ?
You can do anything you like using this code, forking, clone etc. And welcome to add new ideas to this pro.
